# game-lobby-demo

[See a live demo here!](https://game-lobby-demo.web.app/)   

I created this game lobby for another project, which is still in the works.  

This demo primarily uses React, Firebase, and Bootstrap.  

Firebase Authentication is used to sign users in anonymously. The original version used Google Authentication, but I didn't think people would want to use their Google accounts to sign into a demo game-lobby, so I opted for the anonymous login.
